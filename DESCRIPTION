Description: Adds R and JavaScript functions that can be used in RMarkdown 
    to add interactive functionality to HTML documents, using only client-side scripting. For instance, 
    the creator of an RMarkdown document can add 'select' buttons that allow the user of the HTML document
    to swap the images and text that appear throughout the document.
